Massive Attract
===============

A simple HTML5 and Canvas game (leaning on SoundManager 2 for sounds and music) where you're helping out some people on a tiny planet that's getting smaller for some silly reason (let's say over-mining). They need some mass so they don't keep floating away into space, so deflect the asteroids into their planet to increase its mass. They'll deal with the cleanup of dead people, atmospheric pollution, etc, so feel no guilt.

The Excuses
-----------

A Ludum Dare 23 entry. Totally scrappy, messy, crappy, etc. The goal of Ludum Dare is to make *something* in 48 hours and.. well.. most of this game was made in about 4 ;-)

Stuff Used
----------

* SoundManager 2
* Ernest pixel font from http://www.steakknife.org/mieps/fonts/indexn.htm
* GarageBand (despite having Logic Pro.. go figure!)
* Audacity
* jQuery (though only for the dom load it seems.. should replace it with native!)
* mrdoob's stats.js (for the frames per second info, I kept it enabled)
